WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:02.040
OK welcome back my students.

00:02.340 --> 00:08.820
So on this lecture I went to fetch just a couple of bucks that I had and maybe you do as well.

00:09.320 --> 00:15.940
I had a double Jake where we file on the web pack that mitts.

00:15.960 --> 00:16.290
OK.

00:16.290 --> 00:20.370
So I have this duplicate here like this.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.140
And I also had this path wrong.

00:25.240 --> 00:25.630
OK.

00:25.630 --> 00:33.340
So if you have that you can fix it because I was getting a lot of arrows with MP being run def but I

00:33.340 --> 00:34.950
wasn't getting error because of this.

00:34.990 --> 00:40.850
I was getting errors because for some reason I was using Clarabelle Eckel.

00:41.020 --> 00:47.550
And when you use that you've got to make sure that your insight you loosestrife dodgy as file you have

00:49.200 --> 00:51.320
Echo as are the pendency in pushier.

00:51.640 --> 00:59.950
Well not here but if you use it here if you if this is uncommented OK you've got to make sure that in

00:59.990 --> 01:08.350
your package that Jason you have those dependencies because when you run MP and run that you're going

01:08.350 --> 01:13.960
to get those arrows because that's missing is trying to use it but they are missing here so make sure

01:13.960 --> 01:15.540
you have those dependencies there.

01:15.540 --> 01:16.230
OK.

01:16.360 --> 01:26.030
Once you have those appendices Ron MBIA and install O and be run after if it gives you errors then delete

01:26.190 --> 01:29.800
the no modules folder completely.

01:30.110 --> 01:36.870
Then run then and start again and then empyrean run that and you should be good to go.

01:37.210 --> 01:37.610
OK.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.780
If you have any issues make a comment in this lecture and we'll take care of it.

01:42.020 --> 01:47.990
But again if you also have any issues we've got to get her account all you have to do is make a request

01:47.990 --> 01:54.650
like I show you in the beginning of the course and I'll make you a user and you can go ahead and forward

01:54.670 --> 01:57.430
the project but you should be good to go.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.640
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures.
